# Outline
## High-Level Summary 
Horseshoe crab blood is hyper-sensitive to bacterial toxins and consequently is used to test the safety of many medical devices and vaccines, including the Covid-19 vaccine. Horseshoe crab populations are declining, in part due to over-harvesting for biomedical purposes, which is detrimental to their ecosystems. 
## Story Structure
Set-Up: This section will focus on why horseshoe crabs are super cool. I will write about how horseshoe crabs have saved countless lives due their use by the pharmaceutical industry, and also how they play a key role in their ecosystems. Specifically, their eggs are a vital food source for many bird species, including the threatened red knot which depends on horseshoe crab eggs to fuel their 9,000-mile migration from South America up to the Arctic. 

Conflict: This section will focus on the threats that horseshoe crab populations face, specifically the increase in biomedical harvesting over time. Conservatively, of the 600,000 horseshoe crabs that are harvested for biomedical purposes each year, 15% of them die at some point during or after the bleeding process. This is one contributing factor as to why American Horseshoe Crabs are identified as a vulnerable species. I will also write about how horseshoe crab population declines have negative impacts on other species, like the red knot.

Resolution/ Call to Action: The great news is that a synthetic alternative to horseshoe crab blood, recombinant Factor C (rFC), has been developed. Some pharmaceutical companies have already begun to switch their operations to using rFC instead of LAL, the component of the horseshoe crabâ€™s blood used in safety testing. I will also provide a link to steps that a reader can take to get involved in horseshoe crab protection efforts. The Ecological Research and Development Group has created [this website](https://www.horseshoecrab.org/act/act.html) to promote individual action towards horseshoe crab conservation.
## What I Hope to Achieve 
I want to provide readers with more insight into the value of horseshoe crabs so that they can become informed advocates for horseshoe crab conservation. 

# Initial Sketches
Please note, the data shown in these sketches is not accurate as these are only the preliminary sketches used to show the overall concept for the final visualizations.

I plan to use a network diagram for my first sketch to emphasize how many species depend on horseshoe crabs. An initial sketch is provided below. 

Next, I plan to use a line graph to show the rising biomedical horseshoe crab mortalities over time. I will also include a reference line to show how much mortalities have exceeded the mortality threshold determined by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. An initial sketch is provided below. 

Finally, I plan to include a bar chart showing red knot's declining population over time. An initial sketch is provided below.
