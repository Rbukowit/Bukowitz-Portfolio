# About Me
Hello! My name is Rachel (she/her) and I'm a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Public Policy and Management. I'm focusing my studies in Environmental Policy, and hope to work in that field post-graduation. I'm currently a student in a "Telling Stories With Data" course here at CMU. I am thrilled to be in this course to learn about different techniques and software options that I can use to translate complex patterns and information embedded in spreadsheets into easy-to-understand visuals. 

# What I Hope to Learn
As someone who is interested in pursuing a career in environmental policy, I am keen to apply the best practices for presenting data to communicate the seriousness of the climate crisis while also motivating people to take action for a better future. I think that data is a key ingredient in storytelling, and that effective storytelling is one of the most powerful tools for enacting change. I'm looking forward to practicing making data visualizations in this class, and then applying the skills I acquire "out in the real world" after graduating!
