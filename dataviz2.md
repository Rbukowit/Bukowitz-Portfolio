# Grid of Lines Government Debt Data Visualization
Here is a visualization I created on flurish.studio to show general government debt by country from 1995 to 2019. As described on the OECD website, "Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits."
