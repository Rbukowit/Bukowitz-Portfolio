# Grid of Lines Government Debt Data Visualization
Below is a visualization I created on flurish.studio to show general government debt by OECD country from 1995 to 2019. As described on the OECD website, "Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits."

# Bubble Chart Government Debt Data Visualization
Using the same raw data as was used in the grid of lines chart above, below is a bubble chart visualization of general government debt by OECD country from 1995 to 2019. The information displayed on this chart shows the measurement of the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. As described on the OECD website, this measurement is, "a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance."
