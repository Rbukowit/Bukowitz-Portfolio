# Wireframes and Storyboards

I created the following storyboard with wireframes for my final project.

# User Research and Interviews

## Target audience: 

Given that my story focuses on another species and its importance to its ecosystem, the target audience for my story is teenagers or adults who feel a connection to and appreciation for nature (henceforth called nature lovers). I imagine my nature-loving audience is similar to the audience that National Geographic appeals to. Although my story focuses on horseshoe crabs, the story is not intended for audiences who are experts in horseshoe crabs, but rather audiences that are interested, but uninformed about horseshoe crabs and their ecosystem. In this way, my story can stand to educate others who may then be inclined to take action towards protecting horseshoe crabs.

## Sample:

Since my target audience is nature-lovers, I focused my interviews on people that are professionally or personally invested in the natural world. My interviewees consisted of: 
•	A naturalist from a state park that enjoys kayaking and hiking; female, married, mother, mid-50s
•	A pharmacist that section hikes the Appalachian Trail and enjoys camping; female, married, no kids, late 20s
•	A snowmobile and kayaking guide (in the winter and summer, respectively) that enjoys camping and mountain biking; male, single, no kids, early 20s

From these interviews, I hope to find out what sticks out to people who read my story, and if my story is clear as it is presented. More specifically, I want to understand if people think story arc and visualizations flow well. I also want to see how convincing my story is, i.e. after reading this story, do people actually feel motivated to take action? Based on these interviews I will make changes to improve my story and visualizations.


## Research Goals

I used the following questions in the order in which they are presented as my script for my interviews.

Goal |	Question(s)
-----------------------
Engaging |	What is the first thing that sticks in your mind from this story?
Informativeness |	Did you know about this topic before you read the story?  Did you learn something new from this story?
Comprehensibility |	Can you tell me what you think the purpose of this story was? What is the problem? What is the solution? 
Logical Flow |	Did the story make sense to you in the order in which it was presented?  Do you think the visualizations flowed within the storyline?
Convincingness |	Do you feel motivated to take action against this problem? If no, do you have any thoughts about what would motivate you to take action?
Interpretability |	What did you find confusing?
Improvement |	What would you change? Is there anything more you would like to know more about on this topic?

## Interview Findings

Question(s) | 	Naturalist, female, mid-50s |	Pharmacist and hiker, female, late-20s |	Snowmobile and kayak guide, male, early-20s |
------------------------------------
What is the first thing that sticks in your mind from this story? | How much we (people) rely on nature. | Horseshoe crab blood is very useful and incredibly creepy. **The visual of the mortalities with the shading stood out.** | How crucial the area where the horseshoe crabs spawn is for the red knot population.
Did you know about this topic before you read the story?  Did you learn something new from this story? | I knew there was overharvesting of horseshoe crabs, but I did not know about the medical purposes. I learned more about the medical necessity for why they are overharvested. I also learned that you won’t get bit from flipping the crab over. I also didn’t realize how many relationships existed from the horseshoe crab. | I knew nothing about this beforehand, and I am intrigued and shocked that I am a pharmacist and I that I knew nothing of this. | I had vaguely remembered something about horseshoe crab blood being blue, but I didn’t know anything about the importance of it. I learned how crucial it is that the horseshoe crab eggs provide nourishment for the red knots.
