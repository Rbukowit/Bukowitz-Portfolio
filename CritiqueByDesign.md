# Step 1: Find a Data Visualization
I selected the three visualizations shown below, reposted from the blog post, "City population dynamics since 1850."

# Step 2: Critique the Data Visualization
These visualizations show the top ranking U.S. cities over time based on their population. They present the information in line charts, which on the one hand is good since they show change over time. Having years across the x-axis in uniform increments made sense and worked for this visual. However, having rank on the y-axis is confusing. Since a rank of 1 indicated the most populous city, and lower rankings meant lower populations, it is counterintuitive to have the y-axis go from 0-20 because then cities appear to be increasing on the chart when their populations are actually decreasing.
Another critique I have of this chart is that it may be useful to have all of the information in one chart instead of across three charts so viewers can see a more continuous change over time. 
Additionally, the charts each have different colors and symbols representing the cities. For example, Philadelphia is represented in the first chart as a straight yellow line, but in the second chart it is shown as a gray line with a diamond-X shape in it, and in the third chart as a gray line with a square in it. 
In terms of the design choices for the visualizations, the symbols on the lines for each city are unnecessary since the lines are already different colors. 
The symbols on the lines only add clutter to the chart and make it more difficult to read.
Finally, the headlines for the charts could be more descriptive.

#Step 3: Wireframe a Solution
I used Basalmiq to wireframe two possible ways to improve these visualizations. My wireframes are included below.
